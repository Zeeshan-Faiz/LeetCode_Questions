Given a wooden stick of length n units. The stick is labelled from 0 to n. For example, 
a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:
Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at. The cost 
of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. 
When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is 
the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.

Example 1:
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of 
length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the 
last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 
(as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).
